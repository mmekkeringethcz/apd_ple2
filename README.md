# APD_PLE

Python code that uses the wavelength modulation setup and the APD to perform PLE measurements.
Some of the code is similar to APD scanning imaging.

Experimental setup:
Optics:
*  SuperK as whitelight source
*  Beam expander
*  Galvo mirror
*  Grating
*  Lens + single mode fiber
*  APD as detector


Electronic:
*  Function generator (voltage corresponds to wavelength) with TTL output for sync
*  Hydraharp, TTL sync at Marker 3
